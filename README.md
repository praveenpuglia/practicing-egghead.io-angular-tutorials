# Enhanced Angular Demos from egghead.io

All the code I practice after watching those videos. A big thanks to egghead.io :)

# Initializing 

Run `bower install angular` in the root directory.

The demos use few styles from bootstrap to makes a little more visual sense. If you need that, run `bower install bootstrap` in the root directory.
